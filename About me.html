  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, Meet the real marketing nerd!
  </p>
  <p>
  I believe that understanding people’s behavior and studying how they will react <br>
  to certain things is one of the interesting aspects of decision-making from a <br>
  psychological perspective. And here I can just add one of Peter Drucker’s quotes.<br><br>
  “The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well that the <br>
  product or service fits him and sells itself.” – Peter Drucker.<br><br>
  I studied in Tabeetha school and got my GCSE O and A level. That is the place <br>
  where I determined what I want to be. So that, thanks to my work ethic and <br>
  dedication, I could achieve my goal! Besides that, I also have a Network <br>
  Engineering MCSE certification.   </p>
  <p>
  However, knowledge is power and guided by this approach, I decided to keep <br>
  pushing forward. I use every possibility to educate myself and improve my skills.<br>
  I passed a lot of online courses related to business development, digital <br>
  marketing, social media marketing and sales. Being an active member of affLift <br>
  forum and Warrior Forum, I always stay tuned for updates and innovations in the <br>
  world of marketing. I am motivated and inspired by following such marketing gurus <br>
  as Neil Patel, Barry Schwartz, Eric Sui.</p>

  <p>
  Above all, I speak three different languages–English, Arabic, and Hebrew, and <br>
  thanks to these languages, I can connect and cooperate with people from <br>
  all around the world.</p>
